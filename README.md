YouLoop
=======

Google Chrome extension which allows you to play a video forever.

# Installation

Since Google asks anybody who wants to put an extension into the Web Store to pay $5, this extension will not be available on the official Chrome Store. Fuck you Google.

## Packed extension

Just install [the latest release](https://github.com/cGuille/YouLoop/releases) (click on the `YouLoop.crx`green button).

Google does not allow Windows users to install extensions from elsewhere than their Web Store, so if you use this operating system:
- tell Google how annoying they are;
- load the extension from the sources (see the next section below).

## Loading from sources

- download and extract the sources of [the latest release](https://github.com/cGuille/YouLoop/releases);
- follow [Google's instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) to load an unpacked extension.
