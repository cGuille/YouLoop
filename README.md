YouLoop
=======

Google Chrome extension which allows you to play a video forever.

# Installation

Since Google asks anybody who wants to put an extension into the Web Store to pay $5, this extension will not be available on the official Chrome Store. Fuck you Google.

- Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/cGuille/YouLoop/releases);
- download the latest one (right click on the `YouLoop.crx` green button, Save asâ€¦);
- browse to [the Chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions/): `chrome://extensions/` (or in the menu: Tools/Extensions);
- drag & drop the downloaded file to this page;
- proceed the installation.

## The button does not appear

Sometimes, the YouLoop button does not appear next to the video title. It seems that the YouLoop script is somehow not loaded. Just reloading the page should make the button come.

## The button appears but it is crossed and won't work

It means that the video you are watching is not using the HTML5 browser feature. See [the related YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/html5).
